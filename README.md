# awesome-dl
Yet another download manager? Awesome!

This time it's for your server.

_Built with FastAPI and asyncio for Python 3.7+_

## Features
- Download anything that YoutubeDL can download
- I think it's pretty fast 
- _Security features_ like API Keys for API endpoints
- Configurable number of workers for multiple parallel downloads
- Downloaders run in separate processes to handle failures safely
- Download queue persists across application restarts
- Downloads can be cancelled and retried, starting over from where the download left off

## Todos
- Configuration files
- Single Page Web UI that's not the one from FastAPI
